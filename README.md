# MRS Decompiler Gunz

Mrs Decompiler Gunz is a tool that can decompile MRS files into their original formats, such as XML, DDS, or WAV. This tool was created by s00rk, a Gunz modder and developer, who shared it on GitHub. The tool can decompile MRS files that were encrypted with old methods, such as MRS Encrypt Lambda or Steven. These methods were used by some private servers of Gunz in the past, but they are no longer secure or effective. Mrs Decompiler Gunz can also help modders who forgot their encryption code or lost their original files.
